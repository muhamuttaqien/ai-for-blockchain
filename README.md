On the one hand, the idea of decentralisation behind Blockchain addresses the challenge of trustworthy AI.  On the other hand, the tradeoff between security, speed of transaction and energy intensity behind Blockchain could be possibly smartly managed. AI for Blockchain seems legit to me!


Here, I will cover technical fundamental using Python as follows:

Building Blocks
1. Cryptography
2. Decentralization
3. Game Theory

Classified Models
1. Public Blockchains
2. Private Blockchains 
3. Federated Blockchains 

Cryptographic Fundamentals
1. Hash Functions
2. Cryptographic Hash Functions 
3. Digital Signatures

Consensus Mechanisms
1. Proof-of-Work (PoW)
2. Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
